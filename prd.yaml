# 🚨 ExoRoute — Fire Detection and Evacuation Visualization System (Stanford Campus)

## 1. Overview
**ExoRoute** is a real-time fire monitoring and evacuation visualization dashboard built for the **Stanford campus**.  
It combines computer vision–based fire detection with an interactive evacuation map that dynamically guides people to safety when an emergency occurs.

The app is designed as a **command-center dashboard**, blending visual storytelling and actionable intelligence.  
It should look cinematic, intuitive, and data-driven — as if it’s running in the Stanford emergency response HQ.

---

## 2. UI Philosophy

- **Futuristic Control Center aesthetic**: dark background, glowing nodes, clean typography.
- **Calm → Alert transition**: the UI should visually shift tone when fire is detected.
- **Split-screen narrative**: left side shows *what happened*, right side shows *what to do*.
- **Smooth animations**: avoid jumpy transitions; use soft glows, zooms, and fade-ins.

## 3. Screen Layout

### 🧭 **Main Dashboard Layout**

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

[ Left Panel: CCTV Monitoring Feeds ]	[ Right Panel: Evacuation Map ]
- Real-time video tiles	- Stanford map (top-down)
- Fire detection overlays	- Node & route visualization

## 4. Left Panel — “Surveillance Grid”

### Purpose
Displays multiple stationary CCTV feeds from key campus locations, transitioning from routine monitoring to an active alert view when a fire is detected.

### Design Details
- **Layout:** 2x2 grid of video tiles (`Camera A`, `Camera B`, `Camera C`, `Camera D`)
- **Video feeds:** looped clips of pedestrians walking on Stanford campus roads.
- **Overlay elements:**
  - `LIVE` tag (top-left, red)
  - Timestamp (top-right)
  - Camera label (bottom-left, white text, slight blur backdrop)
- **Visual style:**
  - Slight CRT static / vignette effect for realism.
  - Rounded corners (`border-radius: 1rem`).
  - Dim blue-gray color grading before an alert.

### Fire Detection State
When a fire is detected in a camera feed:
- The feed border glows **red** (pulsing).
- A small alert panel appears inside the tile:
🔥 Fire Detected
Location: Hoover Tower Road
Confidence: 97%
Time: 13:26:05

- The remaining camera feeds desaturate (grayscale) to direct attention.

## 5. Right Panel — “Evacuation Map”

### Purpose
Visualizes the affected area on a **stylized map of Stanford’s campus** and dynamically shows safe evacuation routes.

### Base Map
- **Visual style:** Dark slate background with light-gray roads and minimalistic building outlines.
- **Nodes:** Represent each CCTV location (A–D) with small glowing dots (white in normal mode, red in alert).
- **Labels:** Building names, major landmarks (Hoover Tower, Main Quad, etc.).

### Alert Mode (Fire Detected)
- The node corresponding to the affected camera **glows bright red**, expanding softly (pulsing halo).
- A translucent **danger radius** (red gradient circle) appears around the node.
- **Evacuation routes** animate in green:
- Curved lines from the fire node → safe exits.
- Lines pulse outward (indicating direction of movement).
- **Pedestrian icons** (tiny moving dots) simulate people moving along the green routes.

### Info Panel (Right side overlay)
A semi-transparent sidecard with contextual data:
🚨 EMERGENCY ALERT
Fire detected near Hoover Tower Road
Evacuation initiated for nearby zones.

🧭 Safe Exits:

Main Quad Gate

Lasuen Walk

Campus Drive North

👥 Pedestrians Detected: 14
🔥 Fire Confidence: 97%

## 6. Bottom Bar — “Event Timeline & System Status”

### Purpose
Provides temporal context and live system state.

### Elements
- **Timeline:** horizontal scrollable bar showing:
13:24 – Normal monitoring
13:25 – Heat anomaly detected
13:26 – Fire confirmed
13:26 – Evacuation route activated

yaml
Copy code
- **Status metrics (right-aligned):**
- Fire Detected: ✅ / ❌
- Active Routes: 2
- Response Time: 1.8s
- System Mode: ALERT / NORMAL

### Style
- Thin, glowing progress bar animation for timeline flow.
- Subtle haptic-style feedback (pulsing dot) at current timestamp.

## 7. Color Palette

| Purpose | Color | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Background | #0C0F14 | Deep charcoal for contrast |
| Normal text | #E4E4E4 | High readability |
| Accent Blue | #1E90FF | Calm operational mode |
| Alert Red | #FF3B3B | Fire detection / emergency |
| Safe Green | #34D399 | Evacuation routes |
| Map Lines | #7F8C8D | Subtle gray outlines |

---

## 8. Animations & Transitions

| Interaction | Animation | Duration |
|--------------|------------|-----------|
| Fire detected | Red glow pulse + siren sound | 0.5s pulse, continuous |
| Map route reveal | Green line draw animation | 1.2s |
| Info panel open | Slide-in from right + fade | 0.6s |
| Timeline event | Dot blink + progress shift | 0.4s |
| Return to normal | All feeds fade to color, map resets | 1.0s |

All animations should feel **fluid and cinematic**, not game-like — think NASA or smart city dashboards.

## 9. User Flow Summary

1. **Idle Mode (Monitoring)**  
 - 4 CCTV feeds running smoothly.  
 - Map shows all nodes (white).  
 - Status = NORMAL.

2. **Detection Event**  
 - Fire detected in one feed → camera border flashes red.  
 - Right map highlights node.  
 - Alert info panel slides in.  
 - Alarm sound plays softly.  

3. **Evacuation Visualization**  
 - Green evacuation routes animate from red zone.  
 - Pedestrian icons move along paths.  
 - Timeline updates live.

4. **Resolution**  
 - Fire alert clears → red node fades to orange → normal state returns.  
 - Map re-centers and all feeds return to normal color.

## 10. Assets Required

| Asset | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| CCTV videos | MP4 | 4 clips from Stanford campus with pedestrians |
| Fire event video | MP4 | Footage showing a small fire in one node |
| Stanford map | SVG / PNG | Stylized map (top-down) |
| Icons | PNG / SVG | Fire, pedestrian, exit, alert |
| Alert sound | MP3 | Subtle siren or system beep |

---

## 11. Future Enhancements
- Integrate **real-time model inference** via API (e.g., fire detection from webcam feed).
- Add **sensor data overlays** (temperature, smoke density).
- Implement **multi-campus support** via modular node map.
- Add **post-event analytics dashboard**.
